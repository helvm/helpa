    <h2>Section 4: Integrating Whitespace into HaPyLi Applications</h2>
    <div>

        <h3>Whitespace Assembler</h3>
        <div>
        
            <p>There are only two "built-in" expressions in HaPyLi, the "if" statement 
            and the "do" statement. Everything else - including arithmetic and IO -
            are defined within HaPyLi. HaPyLi allows you to embed Whitespace commands
            directly into your applications.</p>

            <p>Of course, coding with nothing but spaces, tabs, and line feeds is tedious,
            unreadable, and error prone. HaPyLi includes within it a little assembly 
            language that closely parallels Whitespace itself. The commands for this
            assembly language are listed below (please refer to the
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150618184706/http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/whitespace/tutorial.php">
            Whitespace tutorial</a>).</p>
        
            <h4>Stack Manipulation</h4>
            <div>
                
                <p>Applicable operands are single-quoted character literals,
                decimal integers, and hexadecimal integers.</p>
                
<pre>
    push n      - push the number 'n' onto the stack.
    dup         - Duplicate the top item on the stack.
    copy n      - Copy the 'n'th item on the stack onto the top of the stack.
    swap        - Swap the top two items on the stack.
    pop         - Discard the top item on the stack.
    slide n     - Slide 'n' items off the stack, keeping the top item. 
</pre>
                
            </div>
        
            <h4>Arithmetic</h4>
            <div>
<pre>
    add         - Addition
    sub         - Subtraction
    mul         - Multiplication
    div         - Integer Division
    mod         - Modulo
</pre>        
            </div>

            <h4>Heap Access</h4>
            <div>
<pre>
    store       - Store
    load        - Retrieve
</pre>
            </div>
            
            <h4>Flow Control</h4>
            <div>

                <p>Applicable operands follow mostly the same syntax as HaPyLi identifiers. 
                For example, "label abc" or "call hello_world".</p>

<pre>
    label x     - Mark a location in the program. 
    call  x     - Call the subroutine.
    jump  x     - Jump unconditionally to a label. 
    jz    x     - Jump to a label if the top of the stack is zero.
    jn    x     - Jump to a label if the top of the stack is negative.
    ret         - End a subroutine and transfer control back to the caller.
    end         - End the program. 
</pre>
            
            </div>
            
            <h4>IO</h4>
            <div>
<pre>
    pc          - Print the character at the top of the stack.
    pn          - Print the number at the top of the stack.
    rc          - Read a character and place it in the location given by the top of the stack.
    rn          - Read a number and place it in the location given by the top of the stack.
</pre>
            </div>
            
            <h4>Annotated Example</h4>
            <div>

                <p>Here's the Whitespace tutorial's example of a program which counts from 1 to 10,
                printing the current value as it goes - translated to HaPyLi + Whitespace Assembler.</p>

                <hr>
<pre>
    <a href="count.hpl">File: count.hpl</a>

        asm main () =
        (
            push    1           ; Put a 1 on the stack.
            label   begin       ; Set a Label at this point.
            dup                 ; Duplicate the top stack item.
            pn                  ; Output the current value.
            push    '\n'        ; Put a newline character on the stack...
            pc                  ; ...and output the newline.
            push    1           ; Put a 1 on the stack.
            add                 ; Addition. This increments our current value.
            dup                 ; Duplicate that value so we can test it.
            push    11          ; Push 11 onto the stack.
            sub                 ; Subtraction. So if we've reached the end, we have a
                                ; zero on the stack.
            jz      the_end     ; If we have a zero, jump to the end.
            jump    begin       ; Jump to the start.
            label   the_end     ; Set the end label.
            
        )
</pre>
                <hr>


                <p>If you compare this with the example in the Whitespace tutorial, you'll notice that
                the last two instructions have been removed - namely, discarding the top item of the 
                stack and explicitly calling "end". In HaPyLi, all functions must leave exactly one item
                on the stack as a return value and the "end" instruction is added automatically by the 
                compiler.</p>
            
            </div>
            
        </div>
        
            
        <h3>Functions Defined with Whitespace Assembler</h3>
        <div>
        
            <p>Other than their bodies, the only difference between assembler functions and ordinary ones
            is the use of the "asm" keyword. Assembler functions can call and be called by any other
            function, they can be inlined, they can contain let-forms, and they always return a value.</p>
        
            <h4>Handling Parameters / Local Variables</h4>
            <div>
            
                <p>The following example illustrates how to refer to parameters and local variables passed 
                to a function through Whitespace Assembler. These variables are indexed starting from 0,
                in reverse order in which they're defined.</p>

        asm f (a b) = 
            let
                c = 2
                d = 1
            in
            (
                copy 3      ; Copy parameter 'a' and print it.
                pn
                push '\n'
                pc 
                
                copy 2      ; Copy parameter 'b' and print it.
                pn
                push '\n' 
                pc 

                copy 1      ; Copy local variable 'c' and print it.
                pn
                push '\n' 
                pc 
                
                copy 0      ; Copy local variable 'd' and print it.
                pn
                push '\n' 
                pc
                
                pop         ; Pop the arguments and local variables
                pop         ; off the top of the stack.
                pop
                pop
                
                push 0      ; Push the return value (just '0' in this case),
                            ; onto the top of the stack. 
            )

        def main () = (print-number (f 4 3))
</pre>
                <hr>
                
                <p>Note that we don't explicitly return from 'f'. The HaPyLi compiler automatically adds the "ret"
                instruction to non-inlined functions and inlined functions should never contain a "ret" anyway.
                Remember that 'inlined' functions are not actually called, but rather their bodies are copied 
                verbatim to wherever the function is referenced. Hence, it doesn't make sense to return from 
                an inline function.<p>
                
                <b>*** IMPORTANT***</b>
                
                <p>When coding in Whitespace Assembler, it is very easy to accidentally corrupt the stack, 
                resulting in nasty and difficult to fix bugs. Functions always pop all of their arguments 
                and local variables, and they push exactly one return value.</p>
                
            </div>
        
            <h4>Labels in Whitespace Assembler Functions</h4>
            <div>
            
                <p>Never use labels in inlined functions. A label must only be defined once in an entire
                application. Inlining an assembler function, however, copies its body - including 
                any label instructions - to wherever the function is referenced.</p>
                
                <hr>
<pre>
    <a href="inline_labels.hpl">File: inline_labels.hpl</a>
                
        import "stdlib/base.hpl"

        asm inline f () = 
        (
            jump  HELLO
            
            label HELLO
            push 0
        )


        def main () = 
            (do (print-number (f))
                (print-number (f)))
</pre>
                <hr>
        
                <p>The above program won't even compile because there are two definitions of
                the label HELLO. Remove the 'inline' modifier, then this program should work.</p>
        
            </div>
        
            <h4>Whitespace Assembler Calling Conventions</h4>
            <div>
            
                <p>All non-inlined functions in HaPyLi are marked by a label 
                named according to the following convention:
                function name, followed by '~' (tilde character), 
                followed by the number of parameters that the function accepts. 
                The example below illustrates how to use this convention to 
                call other HaPyLi functions from Whitespace Assembler.</p>
            
                <hr>
<pre>
    <a href="asmcall.hpl">File: asmcall.hpl</a>
        
        import "stdlib/base.hpl"

        def f () = (print-string "Hello!\n")
        def f (*msg) = (print-string *msg)

        asm main () = 
            let 
                *msg = "Goodbye!\n"
            in
            (
                            ; f~0 accepts no arguments.
                call f~0    ; Call f~0
                pop         ; Pop the return value of f~0
                
                            ; f~1 accepts 1 argument.
                copy 0      ; Pass in *msg. 
                call f~1    ; Call f~1 
                pop         ; Pop the return value of f~1
                
                pop         ; Pop parameters and local variables
                            ; (just *msg in this case). 
                
                push 0      ; Push a return value.
            )
</pre>
                <hr>
            
                <p>Inlined functions cannot be called from Whitespace Assembler because
                they are not associated with any Whitespace labels.</p>
            
            </div>
            
        </div>
            
        <h3>The Heap Pointer</h3>
        <div>
            
            <p>The HaPyLi compiler automatically reserves memory on the heap for global 
            variables and string literals. Afterward, it writes the address of the remaining,
            unallocated memory at address '0' on the heap. This is used by the HaPyLi Standard 
            Library, especially the "alloc" and "read-string" functions, to dynamically allocate
            more memory at runtime.</p>
            
            <p>The only time you'll ever mess with the heap pointer is when writing a new 
            memory management system for HaPyLi. So, unless you really know what you're 
            doing and you have far too much time on your hands, you should never have to
            worry about the heap pointer, ever.</p>
